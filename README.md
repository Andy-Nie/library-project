Overview
--------

The Project Library Management System contains three different modules.
		
•	We can add new books, see the list of added books and search a particular book.
•	Similarly, we can add new students, view the list of all added students with their course details and view a single student.
•	The main module in the project is the Library module.
- We can sell Media to a student or issue only two books to a student.
- The issued period is for twenty days. So within twenty days, the student should return the book or can extend further for a period of twenty days. If neither returned nor extended, a fine of SR.1/day is collected on the day of return.


The menu will be something like this: 

1.	ADD NEW BOOK.
2.	VIEW ALL BOOK DETAILS.
3.	SEARCH A BOOK.
4.	ADD NEW STUDENT.
5.	DISPLAY ALL STUDENT DETAILS. 
6.	VIEW A STUDENT. 
7.	Borrow BOOK.
8.	RETURN BOOK.
9.	EXIT.
